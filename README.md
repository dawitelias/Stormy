# Stormy
Simple weather app following teamtreehouse.com tutorials. Will continue to build out new features.
This app uses the RESTful [forecast.io api](https://developer.forecast.io/).

## Features

### Added
* GPS Geolocation

### In Dev
* Relatively accurate geolocating on Network or Wi-Fi
..* I need way more conditionals for this

### Future Plans
* User postal code input
* Updating weather on a timed interval
* Pull to refresh
* Provide user with option to display weather in notification bar
